## **Homework_Course_Project**
#### Create a Simple Management System:

------------


- One student must enter their name and surname.
- A student who enter name and surname correctly should write "Welcome" on the screen with pring. The Student has the right to enter his/her name and surname incorrectly 3 times.For more than 3 incorrect entries, the system shuts dows and the message "Please try again later" should be printed on the screen.
- 5 courses should be created and these courses should be kept in a list. All of these lessons should be taken from the user.
- This student can take a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 lessons.
- This student cannot take less than 3 courses.
- Otherwise, the message "You failed in class" should be returned to the student by using the return statement.
- The student must choose one of the courses and take an exam. Add the grades from this course to a dictonary and keep the student's grades in this dictonary as midterm, final and project grades.
    - Exapmle: {midterm":38, "final":66,"project":89}
- Percentages for grades
    -  Midterm: 30%
    -  Final: 50%
    - Projext: 20%
- Determine a course passing grade according to the grades received.
    - for notes
        * If the grade is >90, the student should be get AA.
        * If  70 <grade <90 BB
        * If  50 <grade <70 CC
        * If  30 <grade <50 DD
        * If  30 <grade, let FF take.
- If the student has received FF. He/She should print his/her failure on the screen.*
